            <p> Three Hills Floral Club was established in 2010 by three sisters who appreciated how colorful, artistic flowering spaces had the ability to "warm" up a city. 
            Helen, Miriam, and Johanna Keys worked together with the city's government officials to beautify Main Street and City Creek areas. The club members' efforts continue 
            to keep these areas manicured and instate new projects as requested or envisioned. Club meetings are the first Tuesday of each month to discuss current and ongoing projects and scheduling. 
            New members and project volunteers are always welcome!</p>
